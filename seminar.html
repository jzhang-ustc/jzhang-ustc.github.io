<h1 class="block2">Recent Developments in Symplectic Geometry</h1>
  <p>This biweekly online seminar is joint-organized by ShanghaiTech University, USTC-IGP, Yonsei University, and Zhejiang University. 
    This seminar features symplectic and contact geometers presenting current developments on a wide range of topics in these two fields. 
    The talks are aimed at a broad audience.  See also our <a href="reading_seminar.html">symplectic reading seminar</a>.</p>
  
  <p> Organizing committee: Hansol Hong, Junwu Tu, Weiwei Wu, Jun Zhang. </p>

  <p> Title: Complex cobordism, Hamiltonian loops and global Kuranishi chart</p>
  <p> Abstract: Consider a smooth submersion from a symplectic manifold P to the complex line with symplectic fibers. Then we prove that the cohomology of P over the integers is additively isomorphic to the cohomology of the fiber times the base. More generally, we prove such an isomorphism holds with respect to any complex oriented cohomology theory, such as complex cobordism. These results are new even in the special case of smooth projective morphisms to the complex line. To prove our result we use Morava K theories. Our proof also contains a new construction of a global Kuranishi chart for the moduli space of curves. We will mainly focus on the construction of global Kuranishi charts. This is joint work with Abouzaid and Smith.</p>

  <p> Title: Global charts and a product formula for symplectic Gromov-Witten invariants</p>
  <p> Abstract:  I will describe a construction of global Kuranishi charts for the moduli space of stable maps in a closed symplectic manifold (generalizing a construction of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith in genus 0). I will also discuss some applications of this construction including a product formula for Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds. This is based on joint work with Amanda Hirschi.</p>

  <p> Title: Higher dimensional Heegaard Floer homology and Hecke algebras  </p>
  <p> Abstract: Higher dimensional Heegaard Floer homology (HDHF) is a higher dimensional analogue of Heegaard Floer homology in dimension three. It's partly used to study contact topology in higher dimensions. In a special case, it's related to symplectic Khovanov homology. In this talk, we discuss HDHF of cotangent fibers of the cotangent bundle of an oriented surface and show that it is isomorphic to various Hecke algebras. This is a joint work with Ko Honda and Tianyu Yuan.  </p>
